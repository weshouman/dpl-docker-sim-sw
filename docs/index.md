## A Unified Approach for Simulation Software Development in Isolated Environments

This documentation discusses methodologies for unifying the development of simulation software, following the [Simulation Software Engineering Course](https://simulation-software-engineering.github.io/homepage/) at Stuttgart University.


There are 3 different ways for how the containerization would fit and help in the process of developing research/simulation software, namely; building the software, developing the software, and using the software, the 3 different forms are described in the following sections in details.

- [Build Process Isolation](build-process-isolation.md)
- [Software Environment Isolation](sw-env-isolation.md)

## Notes

Throughout the documentation, the containers were preferred over the virtual machines, as the increased level of virtualization wonâ€™t be worth the penalty on the developer (penalty of the storage, processing, memory and time increase) same goes for `lxc` (even with it being much lighter than the virtual machines).
Integration into Kubernetes clusters is also a great bonus for container usage.
